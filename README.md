Purpose:  

- Learn to use graphics in a user interface.  

Create a application that takes the following as field input:  

- Number of iterations. (find a good default)  
- A fraction between 0.0 and 1.0.  (default to 0.5)  
- A color.  (use a default of your choice)   
- A gesture to select points.  
- A gesture to clear the drawing.  

Display a graphic in a user interface design by using a custom ImageView.  

Have the user select a minimum of 3 vertex points in the ImageView by a gesture to start the drawing.  

Draw Algorithm:  

- Once the vertex points are selected, pick a point as a starting location.  

- Randomly pick one of the vertices.  

- Move the user selected fraction [0.0, 1.0] towards the randomly selected vertex.  

- Draw a point of the selected color at the new location.  

- Using the new location as starting location, loop for the user selected interations.  

Hints:  

- extend AppCompatImageView and implement View.OnClickListener   
- @Override public void onDraw(Canvas canvas)  
- Do as little work as possible in your onDraw() function.  
- See canvas.drawPoint and documentation.
